# 🎓 Student Exam Performance Prediction

### End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This project predicts a student’s exam performance based on various socio-economic and personal factors using a **Machine Learning pipeline** built with Python and deployed via **Flask**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Educational institutions often want to understand what factors affect student performance. This project uses **data-driven insights** to predict the **exam score of a student** and help in early intervention or academic guidance.

---

## Problem Statement

Predict a student’s **math score** based on features like:

* Gender
* Race/Ethnicity
* Parental level of education
* Lunch type
* Test preparation course
